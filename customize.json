Every glance, every touch, every whispered ‘I love you’ is etched in my soul, a melody that plays endlessly in my heart. You are my greatest adventure, my sweetest love, and my forever. No words could ever capture the depth of my love for you, but know this—every heartbeat of mine belongs to you, today, tomorrow, and always. 💕",
